# Capture Missionaries Mod for Civilization VII

## Overview
This mod enhances religious warfare in Civilization VII by allowing players to capture enemy missionaries during wartime. It adds a new strategic dimension to religious competition by making missionaries more vulnerable but still capable of spreading religion across borders.

## Features
- **Capture Enemy Missionaries**: During wartime, you can now capture enemy missionaries
- **Missionary Combat System**: 
  - Missionaries have health points that must be reduced to zero
  - They have no attack strength but can be targeted by military units
- **Strategic Positioning**: 
  - Missionaries can no longer stack with other units
  - Each missionary occupies its own tile, making positioning more important
- **Border Travel**: Missionaries can still travel to foreign lands without requiring open borders

## Capturing Mechanics
To capture an enemy missionary:
1. You must be in a state of war with the civilization that owns the missionary
2. Use your military units to attack the missionary and reduce its health to zero
3. Upon defeat, the missionary will be captured
4. Captured missionaries can be used for your own religious purposes
